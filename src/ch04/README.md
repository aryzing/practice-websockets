# Stocks App

This folder contains application code inspired by chapter 4 of O'Reilly's book Websocket.

This folder contains two clients. That in the `client` directory aims to follow the examples presented in the book more closely, details in its [README](./client/README.md). The client in `clientStompWs` is used for exploration into the capabilities and behaviours of several Websocket related technologies.
